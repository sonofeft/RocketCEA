QuickStart
==========

Install RocketCEA
-----------------

The easiest way to install RocketCEA is::

    pip install rocketcea
    
        OR on Linux
    sudo pip install rocketcea
        OR perhaps
    pip install --user rocketcea


Getting Help
------------

After installing with ``pip``, there will be a launch command line program called **rocketcea** or, on Windows, **rocketcea.exe**. 

From a terminal or command prompt window simply type::

    rocketcea

Your browser will launch with these RocketCEA help pages.

Running RocketCEA
-----------------

Any use of RocketCEA begins with an import statement and an instance of CEA_obj::

    from rocketcea.cea_obj import CEA_Obj
    C = CEA_Obj( oxName='LOX', fuelName='LH2')

In the above example, LOX and LH2 are called out, but any propellants on the :ref:`Propellants <propellants_link>` page can be used.

There are a large number of examples included in this document

For instance, look at :ref:`LOX/LH2 Performance <example_1_link>` on the :ref:`Standard Examples <std_examples_link>` page. 

Highlight the source code with your mouse, right click the highlighted code and select **Copy**. 

Paste that code into your text editor and save it to a python file.(for example D:/rocketcea/example_1.py).


At a command prompt, navigate to that subdirectory (D:/rocketcea in the example above) and give the command::

    python.exe example1.py

In many text editors, hitting the **F5** key will execute the code.

Install Problems
----------------

RocketCEA makes heavy use of the `NASA CEA FORTRAN code <https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/CEAWeb/ceaHome.htm>`_.
For RocketCEA, the NASA FORTRAN code has been modified and turned into a python module using `f2py <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/f2py/python-usage.html>`_.

When compiling FORTRAN into a python library, each version of python needs its own compiled library.
The libraries I've provided are::

    Windows python 2.7 32 bit and 64 bit
    Windows python 3.5 32 bit and 64 bit
    Windows python 3.6 32 bit and 64 bit
    Windows python 3.7 32 bit and 64 bit
    
    Ubuntu Linux python 2.7 32 bit and 64 bit
    Ubuntu Linux python 3.5 32 bit and 64 bit
    Ubuntu Linux python 3.6 32 bit and 64 bit

If your version of python is not shown above, or if RocketCEA fails to load the ``py_cea`` module,
you may need to run f2py on the FORTRAN code on your system in order to create ``py_cea.pyd`` or
``py_cea.so`` or some variation thereof.

The source code ``py_cea.f`` is in the install directory of ``rocketcea`` along with a FORTRAN
include file called ``py_cea.inc``. 

Windows Issues
--------------

Commands like::

    pip install rocketcea
    pip3.6 install rocketcea
    
should just work on Windows.

So far, the main issue I've had on a Windows platform is when python is installed in a directory
with a space in the name.  Any directories like ``C:/Python27`` or C:/Python37`` should work fine.

The other issue is with python 3.7 64 bit.
At the time of this writing, matplotlib was not properly installing.
I made matplotlib a dependency of RocketCEA and I assume that python 3.7 will have working support for 
matplotlib soon.

Ubuntu Linux Issues
-------------------


Commands like::

    pip install rocketcea
    pip3 install rocketcea
    
may well fail with any number of messages.

The most common problems can be solved by first installing depenencies like the following.::

    sudo apt-get install python-pip
    sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
    sudo apt-get install python-tkinter

    OR

    sudo apt-get install python3-pip
    sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib
    sudo apt-get install python3-tkinter

    AND PERHAPS

    sudo apt-get install libfreetype6-dev
    sudo apt-get install pkg-config
    sudo apt-get install libgfortran3:i386
    sudo pip install cairocffi
    sudo apt-get install python-gi-cairo
